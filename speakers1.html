							<strong>Title:</strong>
						    <p>Chosen Ciphertext Security from Trapdoor Functions</p>
							<strong>Abstract:</strong>
							<p>Public key encryption is one of the fundamental pillars of cryptography and secure communication. Any encryption system that we would consider deploying or standardizing should be secure against "chosen ciphertext attacks". This gives security against an active attacker that interacts with a private key holder.
			While the community has been successful in developing chosen ciphertext secure systems from specific number theoretic assumptions. Relatively, little is known about constructing these systems from more general and less structured assumptions. In this talk, I'll present a a construction of chosen ciphertext secure public-key encryption from (injective) trapdoor functions. Our construction is black box and assumes no special properties (e.g. ``lossy'', ``correlated product secure'') of the trapdoor function solving a long standing open problem. The work was given the best paper award at the CRYPTO 2020 conference.</p>

					<strong>Title:</strong>
					<p> The Fundamental Formula of Post-Quantum Cryptography</p>
					<strong>Abstract:</strong>
					<p>Security proofs in modern cryptography consist of three parts: 
					(1) a security definition capturing real-world attack scenarios, 
					(2) a computational problem that is widely regarded to be intractable, 
					and (3) a reduction proving security under the computational assumption.
					In this talk, I will discuss various ways in which each of the three components of this fundamental formula need to be updated to account for quantum computers,
					discussing some recent results and interesting open problems.</p>

					<strong>Title:</strong>
				    <p>Authenticated Key Exchange with Tight Security and Supporting State Reveal</p>
					<strong>Abstract:</strong>
					<p>Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocols enable two parties to authenticate each other and compute a shared session key, 
					which can be used for the later secure communications. We discuss the security requirements for AKE, 
					show the modular construction of AKE from Digital Signatures (SIG) and Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM) and Symmetric Encryption (SE), 
					and study how to achieve tight security for AKE in the multi-user multi-challenge settings and in the standard model. 
					We further consider a stronger (tight) security which allows the adversary to observe the states of parties during the AKE protocol. 
					We also propose the concrete instantiations of our AKE construction, resulting in the first tightly secure 2-round (3-round) AKE in the standard model.</p>

					<strong>Title:</strong>
					<p>Composition of Zero-knowledge Proofs: Impossibility, Pitfalls, and More</p>
					<strong>Abstract:</strong>
					<p>General feasibility of zero-knowledge for NP first transforms a target statement into an instance of a NP-complete language,
					 then applies a proof system for the language. 
					 This approach has been considered impractical for its complexity but has become realistic due to intensive research and development motivated by financial applications. 
					 Another approach, which we focus on in this talk, 
					 is to combine zero-knowledge proofs for specific relations to give proof on a statement that can be decomposed into smaller, 
					 specific relations. We revisit simple composition methods and observes potential pitfalls that can be easily overlooked. 
					 We also explore known impossibility results and recent techniques for composition.</p>

					<strong>Title:</strong>
					<p>The Algebraic Group Model</p>
					<strong>Abstract:</strong>
					<p>One of the most important and successful tools for assessing hardness assumptions in cryptography is the Generic Group Model (GGM). Over the past two decades, numerous assumptions and protocols have been analyzed within this model. While a proof in the GGM can certainly provide some measure of confidence in an assumption, its scope is rather limited since it does not capture group-specific algorithms that make use of the representation of the group.
To overcome this limitation, the Algebraic Group Model (AGM) was introduced, a model that lies in between the Standard Model and the GGM. It is the first restricted model of computation covering group-specific algorithms yet allowing to derive simple and meaningful security statements. 
In this talk we will formally define the AGM and discuss its usefulness in the context of concrete security reductions.</p>
